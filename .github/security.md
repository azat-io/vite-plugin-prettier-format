# Security

To report a vulnerability, please open a private vulnerability report at <https://github.com/azat-io/vite-plugin-prettier-format/security>.

While the discovery of new vulnerabilities is rare, we also recommend always using the latest version of ESLint Plugin De Morgan to ensure your application remains as secure as possible.
